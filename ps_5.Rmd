```

## Question 1: Mad Libs

```{r mad_lib_1, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to insert in-line for mad lib 1

# learning how to use read_dta was simple enough

voters <- read_dta("raw-data/ns20191226/ns20191226.dta")

# used glimpse(voters) and View(voters) to get a sense for what the data looked
# like. Also spent some time in the codebook to figure out what all the
# different variables and values represented

# Found the gun_registry variable and the code for its values in the codebook;
# filtered for everything except 888 ("not asked"). Ran count() and it gave me
# the count for each value, so I summed the counts to find the total number of
# people who were asked the gun registry question. Added a commat to niceley
# format the answer for the .html

mad_1 <- voters %>% 
  filter(gun_registry != 888) %>% 
  count(gun_registry) %>% 
  summarize(sum(n)) %>% 
  pull() %>% 
  format(big.mark = ",")

```

**ML 1)** Not all respondents were asked every question. **`r mad_1`** respondents were asked the question about whether the USA should create a gun registry.

```{r mad_lib_2, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to insert in-line for mad lib 2

# Started by selecting just the relevant variables (the four gun policy
# questions and household_gun_owner) to make the data easier to look at and see
# what needed to be done. Could see from the codebook that only gun_registry and
# statements_gun_rights had people who weren't asked, so I assumed everyone had
# been asked the other two gun policy questions and filtered the data to keep
# only those who were asked both gun_registry and statements_gun_rights. I then
# added a new lgl column to tell me if a person was a gun owner, and took the
# mean (which treats TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0) to find the percentage who owned
# guns. Added percent() at the end to format nicely.

mad_2 <- voters %>% 
  filter(gun_registry != 888,
         statements_gun_rights != 888) %>% 
  mutate(gun_owner = ifelse(household_gun_owner == 1,
                            TRUE,
                            FALSE)) %>%  
  summarize(mean(gun_owner)) %>% 
  percent(digits = 2)

```

**ML 2)** Of the respondents that got asked all four gun policy questions, **`r mad_2`** are gun owners.

```{r mad_lib_3, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns two objects to insert in-line for mad lib 3

# Again, I started by selecting just the relevant columns (household_gun_owner
# and statements_gun_rights) just to make the data easy to see as I was working
# with it, but took out those lines of code after I finished to make the code
# more concise. Filtered here to keep just those who said there wasn't a gun in
# their household (household_gun_owner == 3) and to keep just those values under
# statements_gun_rights that mapped to strongly agree/agree/disagree/strongly
# disagree (i.e. filtering out the values 888 for "not asked" and 999 for "not
# sure"). Then took the mean of the values remaining to find the average
# agreement score. Rounded to two digits for nice formatting.

no_guns <- voters %>% 
  filter(household_gun_owner == 3,
         statements_gun_rights == 1:4) %>% 
  summarize(mean(statements_gun_rights)) %>% 
  round(digits = 2)

# Exactly the same process as above, except I filter for household_gun_owner ==
# 1:2, so I get only those who said that they or someone in their household DO
# own a gun.

have_guns <- voters %>% 
  filter(household_gun_owner == 1:2,
         statements_gun_rights == 1:4) %>% 
  summarize(mean(statements_gun_rights)) %>% 
  round(digits = 2)

```

**ML 3)** The average “agreement” score (from 1-4) on the statement_gun_rights variable is **`r no_guns`** for those respondents who live in households without guns, while the average “agreement” score in households with guns is **`r have_guns`**.

```{r mad_lib_4, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns two objects to insert in-line in mad lib 4

# This one gave me grief for a while, but then the "use group_by(), count(), and
# arrange(desc(n))" suggestion on Piazza really came to the rescue. Using
# mutate() to add a new column with the factor names was another useful tip I
# got from Piazza (thanks, Preceptor!). I added as.character() around the
# as.factor() conversion so I'd be able to easily pull the values out as
# strings, and then ran as.data.frame() so I could easily slice() the row and
# pull() the columns I wanted. Note that the filter command is looking for (age
# < 30), which in theory is different from the 18-30 range the problem asks for,
# but I ran min(age) and found that the lowest value was 30, so I made the code
# more concise by eliminating the (age >= 18) line I otherwise would have
# needed.

mad_4a <- voters %>% 
  filter(age < 30) %>% 
  group_by(religion) %>% 
  count(religion) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(religion_names = as.character(as_factor(religion))) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  pull(religion_names)

# Same process as above, except this time instead of filtering for those under
# age 30, I filtered for (age >= 30).

mad_4b <- voters %>% 
  filter(age >= 30) %>% 
  group_by(religion) %>% 
  count(religion) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(religion_names = as.character(as_factor(religion))) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  pull(religion_names)

```

**ML 4)** Another set of questions asks about religion. The first ranked category of religion for the age group of people 18-30 is **"`r mad_4a`."** The first-ranked religion category for people 30 and older is **“`r mad_4b`.”**

```{r mad_lib_5, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns two objects to insert in-line in mad lib 5

# I use a very similar process to that in mad lib 4, filtering for the age group
# first, then counting the occurrences of each religion, adding a column with
# religion names, putting in descending order, and coercing the data into a
# dataframe structure. I then add a new column, rank, with values 1:14 (I
# checked beforehand to see how many observations I had). Filtering for
# (religion_names == "Nothing in particular") and pulling the rank value tells
# me where the "nones" ranked in this age category.

mad_5a <- voters %>% 
  filter(age < 30) %>% 
  group_by(religion) %>% 
  count(religion) %>% 
  mutate(religion_names = as_factor(religion)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  mutate(rank = 1:14) %>% 
  filter(religion_names == "Nothing in particular") %>% 
  pull(rank)

# Identical process to the above, except this time I filter for (age >= 30).

mad_5b <- voters %>% 
  filter(age >= 30) %>% 
  group_by(religion) %>% 
  count(religion) %>% 
  mutate(religion_names = as_factor(religion)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  mutate(rank = 1:14) %>% 
  filter(religion_names == "Nothing in particular") %>% 
  pull(rank)

# give up...

```

**ML 5)** Lots of people say that the younger generation has the highest percent of “nones” (people who answer “nothing in particular”, when you ask them their religion). In the 18-30 age group, “nothing in particular” is ranked **`r mad_5a`**, while in the 30 and above group, “nothing in particular” is ranked **`r mad_5b`**.

```{r mad_lib_6, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to insert in-line in mad lib 6

# Very similar process to that used in mad libs 4 and 5. Filter first, to keep
# only those values where religion is "nothing in particular" (using the
# codebook to know that the numerical factor equivalent is 12) and
# statements_gun_rights was asked (!= 888). (It appears that all respondents
# were asked for their religion.) I then group_by(), count(), and
# arrange(desc(n)) to find the counts for each response to the question about
# gun rights and put them in descending order. I add a new column (gun_position)
# for the factor labels, converting it to a character string. I coerce all
# values into a dataframe, then slice() and pull() to get just the most popular
# position.

mad_6 <- voters %>% 
  filter(religion == 12,
         statements_gun_rights != 888) %>% 
  group_by(statements_gun_rights) %>% 
  count(statements_gun_rights) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(gun_position = as.character(as_factor(statements_gun_rights))) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  pull(gun_position)

```

**ML 6)** In the group of "nones," the most popular position is to **"`r mad_6`"** that it is more important for the government to control who owns guns than it is for the government to protect the right to own guns.

## Question 2: Simulations with List Columns

#### 2a)

```{r question_2a, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk defines a function to draw n cards. It's pretty straightforward,
# taking n as a parameter and throwing an error if n is not numeric. It defines
# "cards" to just have the suit of the card, and uses sample() to pull from
# cards n times, replacing after each draw.

draw_cards <- function(n) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(n))
  cards <- c("diamonds", "hearts", "spades", "clubs")
  sample(cards, n, replace = TRUE)
}

```

I wrote a function to sample the suit of n cards.

#### 2b)

```{r question_2b, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk creates a one-column tibble, drawing two cards ten times and
# saving those draws in a list-column named "draws". The map() function passes
# the value 2 into the function draw_cards, repeating ten times.

two_cards_ten_times <- tibble(draws = map(rep(2, 10), draw_cards))

```

I made a tibble that shows the result of drawing 2 cards 10 times.

#### 2c)

```{r question_2c, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk adds two new columns to the two_cards_ten_times tibble. Both
# columns are type lgl; the first shows TRUE if the first drawn card is red, and
# the second shows TRUE if the second drawn card is red.

# Using the assignment pipe operator from magrittr to modify two_cards_ten_times

two_cards_ten_times %<>%
  
# Using mutate() to create a new column; map_lgl() takes the draws column and
# cycles through each element of it, using ifelse() to assign the value TRUE to
# first_red if the first drawn card is either a heart or a diamond, and FALSE
# otherwise.
  
  mutate(
    first_red = map_lgl(draws,
                        ~ ifelse(.[[1]][1] == "hearts" |
                                   .[[1]][1] == "diamonds",
                                 TRUE,
                                 FALSE)))

# Same process as above, but this time the new column is second_red, and the
# code is modified to assign TRUE to second_red if the SECOND card in draws is
# either a heart or diamond, and FALSE otherwise

two_cards_ten_times %<>%
  mutate(
    second_red = map_lgl(draws,
                        ~ ifelse(.[[2]][1] == "hearts" |
                                   .[[2]][1] == "diamonds",
                                 TRUE,
                                 FALSE)))

```

I added two columns (one for each card drawn) which say whether the card was red (hearts or diamonds) or not.

#### 2d)

I added a third new column, showing the color outcome of each draw, and produced the following table:

```{r question_2d, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk adds a third column new column (fourth overall) to the
# two_cards_ten_times tibble, and displays the tibble in a nice gt table.

# Again using the assignment pipe operator from magrittr, I modify
# two_cards_ten_times to add a new column. case_when() assigns the value "Both
# red" to outcome when first_red and second_red are both true, "Both black" when
# they're both false, and "Mixed" otherwise.

two_cards_ten_times %<>%
  mutate(outcome = case_when(
    first_red == TRUE & second_red == TRUE ~ "Both red",
    first_red == FALSE & second_red == FALSE ~ "Both black",
    TRUE ~ "Mixed"
  ))

# I pipe two_cards_ten_times into gt() to produce a nice table, adding a title
# and subtitle while adjusting the displayed column titles

two_cards_ten_times %>% 
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Drawing Two Cards",
             subtitle = "Card Colors") %>% 
  cols_label(draws = "Draw",
             first_red = "First card red?",
             second_red = "Second card red?",
             outcome = "Color Outcome")

```

#### 2e)

```{r question_2e, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk creates a simulation identical to the table created above, except
# it replicates the drawing 1,000 times instead of just 10. It then takes the
# proportion of draws that are "mixed" (one red and one black card) and prints
# it in the knitted .html.

# Copied and pasted the code I used above to create the two_cards_ten_times
# tibble, modifying it just to change the 10 replications to 1,000.

simulation_1000 <- tibble(draws = map(rep(2, 1000), draw_cards)) %>% 
  
# Copied and pasted the first part of code from 2c, adding a column to show if
# the first drawn card is red
  
  mutate(
    first_red = map_lgl(draws,
                        ~ ifelse(.[[1]][1] == "hearts" |
                                   .[[1]][1] == "diamonds",
                                 TRUE,
                                 FALSE))) %>% 

# Copied and pasted the second part of code from 2c, adding a column to show if
# the second drawn card is red  
  
  mutate(
    second_red = map_lgl(draws,
                        ~ ifelse(.[[2]][1] == "hearts" |
                                   .[[2]][1] == "diamonds",
                                 TRUE,
                                 FALSE))) %>% 

# Copied and pasted the code from 2d, adding a column to show the draw outcome
# (both red, both black, or mixed)
  
  mutate(
    outcome = case_when(
      first_red == TRUE & second_red == TRUE ~ "Both red",
      first_red == FALSE & second_red == FALSE ~ "Both black",
      TRUE ~ "Mixed")
  )

# Finally, something new: I add a new column (mixed) which takes the value TRUE
# if outcome is "mixed", and FALSE otherwise. I then take the mean of that
# column to measure the proportion of outcomes which are mixed, and use
# percent() to format it nicely, with two decimal places shown. I assign the
# result to an object (percent_mixed) to insert in-line below.
  
percent_mixed <- simulation_1000 %>% 
  mutate(mixed = ifelse(outcome == "Mixed",
                        TRUE,
                        FALSE)) %>% 
  summarize(mean(mixed)) %>% 
  percent(digits = 2)

```

A simulation of drawing two cards 1000 times resulted in **`r percent_mixed`** of draws having "mixed" colors.

## Question 3: Modeling a Study Population

```{r question_3, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk creates a tibble with the study population (showing each
# student's id and grade) and another tibble with the population grouped by
# grade, showing the number of students in each grade and the percent of the
# total student body for each grade. It then plots the latter tibble.

# Making a tibble with the study population, giving IDs to students from 1:6120
# and giving the grade column values corresponding to the number of students per
# class as designated in the question prompt. Note that the grades will not be
# in ascending order (freshman->sophomore->junior->senior) but rather in the
# order in which they appear in the plot I'll be replicating.

pop <- tibble(id = 1:6120,
              grade = c(rep("freshman", 1800),
                        rep("junior", 1570),
                        rep("senior", 1300),
                        rep("sophomore", 1450)))

# Creating a new tibble from the old one, grouping by grade and counting to get
# the number of students per grade. Adding a new column to show the percentage
# of students who belong to each grade.

pop_w_pct <- pop %>% 
  group_by(grade) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  mutate(pct = n / nrow(pop))

# Creating a nice plot with the grouped data in pop_w_pct. I use theme_classic()
# to get rid of clutter in the background, and add labels using the text in the
# plot I'm replicating from the question prompt. I call scales::percent to
# format the y axis labels appropriately, and use geom_text() to map the
# percentage values of each column on top of the columns (using vjust = -0.5 to
# align them in an aesthetically pleasing way).
  
ggplot(pop_w_pct, aes(grade, pct)) +
  geom_col()  +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "University Composition by Grade",
       subtitle = "Entire Study Population") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  geom_text(aes(label = percent(pct, digits = 1),
                vjust = -0.5))

```

## Question 4: Sampling

```{r question_4, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk creates a tibble showing the results of replicating 5,000 samples
# of 25 students each, with columns showing the number and percentage of
# freshmen in each sample. It then plots the sampling distribution of percentage
# freshmen.



samples <- set.seed(02139) %>% 
  rep_sample_n(tbl = pop, size = 25, replace = FALSE, reps = 5000) %>% 
  group_by(replicate, grade) %>%
  count() %>% 
  mutate(n_freshmen = ifelse(grade == "freshman",
                             n,
                             NA)) %>%
  mutate(pct_freshmen = n_freshmen / 25)
  

samples %>% 
  subset(!is.na(pct_freshmen)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pct_freshmen)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent,
                     breaks = c(0, .1, .2, .3, .4, .5, .6)) +

# Add count to bars??

```

## Question 5: Sample Size

```{r question_5, echo=FALSE}

sizes <- list(25, 50, 100, 500)
sizes <- set_names(sizes, names = sizes)

# sizes_p <- list(2, 3, 4, 5)
# sizes_p <- set_names(sizes_p, names = sizes_p)
# 
# map_sample_practice <- function(size){

# 
# sample_dist_practice <- map_df(sizes_p, map_sample_practice)

# sample_dist_practice %>% 
#   group_by(replicate) %>% 
#   summarize(n_freshmen = sum(grade == "freshman"))

map_sample <- function(size){
  set.seed(02139) %>% 
    rep_sample_n(tbl = pop, size = size, replace = FALSE, reps = 5000) %>% 
    mutate(size = size)
}

sample_dist <- map_df(sizes, map_sample)

grouped_sample_dist <- sample_dist %>%
  group_by(replicate, size) %>% 
  summarize(n_freshmen = sum(grade == "freshman")) 

with_prop_freshmen <- grouped_sample_dist %>% 
  mutate(pct_freshmen = n_freshmen / size)

## Question 6: Publish the Plot

View my published plot at https://rpubs.com/wkcook/585752

```{r question_6, echo=FALSE}

# If I were to include a call to print my saved plot, it would look like this:

# include_graphics("dist_by_sample_size.png")

# But I already printed the plot under question 5, so I saw no need to print it
# again here

## Question 8: Understanding Sampling

Although my country has ten states, the population is extraordinarily dense; the five major cities are home to 70% of the total population. Because I only care about the popular vote, **I'll spend the last of my polling budget running 5 polls of 1,000 randomly sampled people** (one in each major city).

The best way to obtain accurate information about the voting preferences of the **population** (every person in my country) would be a **census**, but unfortunately that isn't possible; unlike Mike Bloomberg, I just don't have that kind of money to spare. The next best way to get the info I want about the **population parameter** (the proportion of voters who will choose me) is through **sampling**. A larger sample size means less variability, which should translate to a more accurate **point estimate** than we would obtain with smaller samples. In other words, with a few large samples rather than more smaller samples, we can be more confident that the estimates we make from our samples are accurately describing the population. This is important! I want to know with confidence what matters to urban voters and where to focus my efforts to win their vote.

Furthermore, because 70% of the total population lives in the five major cities, our **random samples** across those cities can be assumed to be fairly **representative** and **generalizable** - that is, the sample's characteristics should approximate the population's characteristics, meaning the sample proportion of people who will vote for me should be close to the actual population proportion of people who will vote for me. Of course, by focusing exclusively on the urban areas in these polls, we're ignoring the 30% of the country that live elsewhere, and our results may not be generalizable to them; our sample is **biased** toward urban voters. But prior polls have estimated that in rural areas I have a double-digit lead over my rivals, so I'm not too concerned about that.
